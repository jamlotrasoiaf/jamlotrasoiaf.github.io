So.....Hello!

This is Frodo and Olaf speaking, and this is *yet another* attempt at making a blog.  
This time we hope that things will go smoothly. We're supposed to be studying rn, but this has caught our attention more for now. making blogs is fun ;)

Not going to keep this long as we need to test if this works. So that's about it! Hope to see you soon! Sunny out!
